# TODO
- fix depth checks, so that we can render characters in front of the obstacles
- choose between silly characters
  - image up to the left corner of the screen
    - should react to different things happening in the game
- obstacles
    - snowman
    - other skiers
    - other things 
      - poop
      - yellow snow
- rewards
Create a silly ski game
It is for kids and can be silly and fun
The game area should scroll itself and player controls the character to left and right
Can also increase their speed by pressing down



## Later
- Concentrate on tablet mode first
  - thumb places for tablet mode



## Assets
- ✔️character sprites
- obstacle sprites
  - snowman
  - ✔️tree
  - ✔️rock
  - other skiers
  - other things 
    - poop
    - yellow snow
  - rewards
    - points for collecting items


## Tech
- p5.js
  - will use a spritesheet with the character animations
  - can probably use a different sheet for all the obstacles
- typescript
