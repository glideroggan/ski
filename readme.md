# Description
Create a silly ski game
It is for kids and can be silly and fun
The game area should scroll itself and player controls the character to left and right
Can also increase their speed by pressing down

# BUGS
- fix the collision when going through the gates
- menu showing distance covered needs adjustments, we should calculate meter better
- menu showing number of crashes, which is not needed
- skiier left falling is offsetted badly in the sprite
- UI Text is blurry
- wrong color of jacket on skier 2
- wrong color on hat and jacket on skier 3

# TODO
- switch to use shaders and webGL
- fix the little face in the corner that can react to things happening in the game
  - need to generate the faces
    - idle
    - happy
    - sad
    - angry
    - surprised
    - scared
- choose between silly characters
  - image up to the left corner of the screen
    - should react to different things happening in the game
- obstacles
    - other skiers
    - other things 
      - poop
      - yellow snow
- rewards


# To implement
## Slalom Gates
Slalom gates will create focused challenge areas where players must navigate between pairs of flags. This adds skill-based challenges to break up normal obstacle avoidance gameplay.

Bugs:
- Still counted as crash going through the gates
- we should remove the color of the gates
- ‚úîÔ∏èrotated obstacles are totally read/rendered wrong
- we need to adjust the collision box for the gates
- we need to adjust the "success" box for the gates

Implementation Steps:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Create SlalomGate entity class
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Design gate visuals (red and blue flags with connecting banner)
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Implement collision detection for passing between gates
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Add visual feedback when gates are successfully passed

- ‚úîÔ∏è Gate Placement System:
  - [ ] Design course patterns (easy, medium, hard)
  - [ ] Implement course section spawn logic in EntityManager
  - [ ] Create spacing logic to ensure gates are positioned properly

- [ ] Difficulty Progression:
  - [ ] Easy: Wide gates with generous spacing
  - [ ] Medium: Moderate width gates with rhythm changes
  - [ ] Hard: Narrow gates with tight turns

- [ ] Scoring & Rewards:
  - [ ] Add points for each gate successfully passed
  - [ ] Implement bonus multiplier for consecutive gates
  - [ ] Create special reward for completing an entire section

- [ ] Technical Components:
  - [ ] Track missed/hit gates with counter
  - [ ] Add timer for slalom sections
  - [ ] Implement visual/audio cues for success/failure

# Improvements to weather changes
Advanced Implementation Ideas
Weather Zones: Create regions on the map with different typical weather patterns
Weather Warning System: Visual/audio cues before weather changes
Special Equipment: Allow player to find and use items like goggles to improve visibility in storms

## FEATURES


## IDEAS
### Jump Ramps
Jump ramps would utilize the existing snowdrift mechanics but with added gameplay elements for performing tricks and getting air time.

Implementation Ideas:

Ramp Types:
Small Kickers: Easy jumps for beginners
Medium Jumps: Good height but manageable landings
Big Air: Massive jumps with higher risk/reward
Physics Enhancement:
Air control (limited steering while airborne)
Trick system (pressing combinations of keys during jumps)
Landing mechanics (land straight or crash)
Visual Effects:
Trail effects during jumps
Character animations for tricks
Landing impact effects
Scoring System:
Points for air time
Multipliers for trick complexity
Clean landing bonuses
Technical Implementation:

Extend the existing snowdrift heightmap to create dedicated jump ramps
Add jump detection when player crosses the lip of a ramp at sufficient speed
Implement an in-air state with special physics
Create landing detection with success/failure conditions
### Map progression
- once you finsh the first slope on the mountain, you will see a map of your progression, which will show additional slopes...
  - üîßdevelop the idea
### Gameplay Mechanics
Ski Jump Ramps: Allow players to perform jumps and tricks for bonus points
Different Snow Types: Add ice patches (faster, less control) and deep powder (slower, more control)
Multiple Paths: Fork the ski run into easy/hard paths with different rewards
### Progression & Variety
Increasing Difficulty: Start with simple obstacles, gradually add more complex patterns
Day/Night Cycles: Skiing at night requires lanterns or glowing obstacles
Mountain Zones: Different themed areas (forest, village, mountain peak)
Difficulty Scaling: Weather could change more frequently as the game progresses, increasing the challenge
### Interactive Elements
#### Power-ups:
Hot chocolate: Speed boost
Helmet: Temporary protection from one collision
Magnet: Attracts nearby collectibles
#### Collectibles: Coins, stars, or silly items like lost mittens
### Fun Additions
Animal Friends: Birds that fly alongside or squirrels that cheer
Secret Easter Eggs: Hidden paths or surprise characters
Silly Physics: Exaggerated crash animations or bouncy snow piles
Avalanche Chase Scenes: Occasional "run from the avalanche" segments



## Later
- Concentrate on tablet mode first
  - thumb places for tablet mode



## Assets
- obstacle sprites
  - ‚úîÔ∏èsnowman
  - ‚úîÔ∏ètree
  - ‚úîÔ∏èrock
  - ‚úîÔ∏èother skiers
  - other things 
    - poop
    - yellow snow
  - rewards
    - points for collecting items


## Tech
- ‚úîÔ∏èp5.js
  - ‚úîÔ∏èwill use a spritesheet with the character animations
  - ‚úîÔ∏ècan probably use a different sheet for all the obstacles
